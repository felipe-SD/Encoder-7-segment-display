## What is Tiny Tapeout?

Edited from tiny tapeout template
Tiny Tapeout is an educational project that aims to make it easier and cheaper than ever to get your digital and analog designs manufactured on a real chip.
To learn more and get started, visit https://tinytapeout.com.

## Wokwi Projects

A BCD to 7-segment encoder is a digital logic circuit that converts
a Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) input into signals that can drive a 7-segment display.
BCD represents decimal digits 0â€“9 in 4-bit binary:

Outputs
7 segments of the display: a, b, c, d, e, f, g
Each output controls one segment. A high (1) signal lights up the segment, and low (0) turns it off.
Optional DP (decimal point) can also be controlled.

Working Principle
The circuit maps each BCD input to the combination of segments that 
forms the corresponding decimal digit on the 7-segment display.
For example, to display 0, segments a, b, c, d, e, f are ON, and g is OFF.
AND EXTRA GATES INCLUDE CONTROL OF POINT 

Edit the [info.yaml](info.yaml) and change the `wokwi_id` to the ID of your Wokwi project. You can find the ID in the URL of your project, it's the big number after `wokwi.com/projects/`.

The GitHub action will automatically fetch the digital netlist from Wokwi and build the ASIC files.
